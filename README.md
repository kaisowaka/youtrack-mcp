## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/itsalfredakku/youtrack-mcp.git
cd youtrack-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

## Configuration

Copy the example environment file and configure it with your YouTrack instance details:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration:

```properties
# YouTrack instance URL (without trailing slash)
YOUTRACK_URL=https://your-instance.youtrack.cloud

# YouTrack permanent token
# Generate from: Profile > Account Security > Tokens
YOUTRACK_TOKEN=your-permanent-token-here

# Optional: Default project ID
PROJECT_ID=PROJECT-1

# Optional: Enable webhooks (true/false)
ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false

# Optional: Webhook server port (default: 3000)
WEBHOOK_PORT=3000

# Optional: Webhook secret for signature verification
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret

# Optional: Log level (error, warn, info, debug)
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Optional: Cache TTL in milliseconds (default: 300000 = 5 minutes)
CACHE_TTL=300000

# Optional: Enable cache (true/false, default: true)
CACHE_ENABLED=true
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

```bash
# Start the MCP server
npm start

# Start in development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev
```

### Running as a Remote MCP Server

```bash
# Start the SSE-based remote server
npm run start:remote

# Hot-reload while iterating on the remote server
npm run dev:remote
```

- Remote SSE endpoint: `http://localhost:3001/mcp/sse`
- Message POST endpoint: emitted automatically as `http://localhost:3001/mcp/messages?sessionId=...`
- Health check: `http://localhost:3001/health`
- Configuration: set `PORT` (default `3001`) and `MCP_BASE_PATH` (default `/mcp`) before starting the process

When deploying behind HTTPS, expose the same endpoints over `https://` so ChatGPT can reach them.

### ChatGPT Custom Connector Setup

1. Deploy the remote server (container, VM, or serverless) with the required environment variables (`YOUTRACK_URL`, `YOUTRACK_TOKEN`, optional `PORT`/`MCP_BASE_PATH`).
2. Ensure the SSE endpoint `https://<your-domain>/mcp/sse` is reachable from the public internet and that long-lived HTTP connections are allowed by your proxy/load balancer.
3. In ChatGPT → Settings → Custom connectors, choose **Add MCP server** and supply the SSE URL from step 2. The connector will receive the POST endpoint automatically from the server.
4. Store any YouTrack credentials as secrets in the connector configuration rather than hard-coding them in code deployments.

After saving the connector you can test connectivity from ChatGPT. Successful initialization will list the YouTrack tools exposed by this server.

### Interacting with the Server

The YouTrack MCP server exposes tools following the Model Context Protocol. LLM applications can discover and use these tools to interact with YouTrack.

#### Example: Creating an Issue

```json
{
  "tool": "create_issue",
  "params": {
    "projectId": "PROJECT-1",
    "summary": "Implement new feature",
    "description": "We need to implement the new feature as described in the specs.",
    "type": "Task",
    "priority": "Normal"
  }
}
```

#### Example: Searching Issues

```json
{
  "tool": "search_issues",
  "params": {
    "query": "project: PROJECT-1 #bug state: Open",
    "limit": 10
  }
}
```

#### Example: Starting Work on an Issue

```json
{
  "tool": "start_working_on_issue",
  "params": {
    "issueId": "PROJECT-1-123",
    "comment": "Starting implementation of this feature",
    "estimatedTime": "2d"
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

The server provides 60+ tools for interacting with YouTrack. Here are some of the most commonly used:

### Issue Management
- `create_issue` - Create a new issue
- `get_issue` - Get issue details
- `update_issue` - Update an issue
- `add_issue_comment` - Add a comment to an issue
- `search_issues` - Search for issues

### Agile & Sprint Management
- `list_sprints` - List all sprints
- `create_sprint` - Create a new sprint
- `assign_issue_to_sprint` - Add an issue to a sprint
- `get_sprint_issues` - Get all issues in a sprint

### State Management
- `start_working_on_issue` - Begin work on an issue
- `change_issue_state` - Change an issue's state
- `complete_issue` - Mark an issue as completed

### Knowledge Base
- `create_article` - Create a knowledge base article
- `update_article` - Update an article
- `get_article` - Get article details
- `search_articles` - Search knowledge base articles

### Project Management
- `list_projects` - List all accessible projects
- `get_project_details` - Get project information

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm 8.x or later
- A YouTrack instance with API access

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start in development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Build the project
npm run build
```

### Project Structure

- `src/index.ts` - Main entry point
- `src/youtrack-client.ts` - YouTrack API client
- `src/tools/` - Individual MCP tool implementations
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `src/config/` - Configuration management

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:queries
npm run test:issues
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication errors**: Verify your YouTrack token has the necessary permissions and hasn't expired.

2. **Project not found**: Ensure the project ID exists and is accessible to your account.

3. **API rate limiting**: YouTrack may impose rate limits. Consider implementing retry logic for critical operations.

4. **State transition errors**: Some state transitions may be prohibited by your YouTrack workflow configuration.

### Logs

Logs are stored in the `logs` directory:

- `combined.log` - All log entries
- `error.log` - Error-level logs only

Set the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to control logging verbosity (error, warn, info, debug).
